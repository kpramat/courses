## Software
* Computer software, or simply software, is that part of a computer system that consists of encoded information or computer instructions, in contrast to the physical hardware from which the system is built
* In computer science and software engineering, computer software is all information processed by computer systems, programs and data
* Computer software includes computer programs, libraries and related non-executable data, such as online documentation or digital media
* Computer hardware and software require each other and neither can be realistically used on its own

* A computer requires programs to function, and typically executes the program's instructions in a central processing unit
* A computer program is usually written by a computer programmer in a programming language
* From the program in its human-readable form of source code, a compiler can derive machine codeâ€”a form consisting of instructions that the computer can directly execute
* Alternatively, a computer program may be executed with the aid of an interpreter
* A part of a computer program that performs a well-defined task is known as an algorithm. 
* A collection of computer programs, libraries and related data are referred to as software
